This grader gives a grade at the end of the run unlike mine because I did not get to that part of the implamentation. 
My implamentation however does include the exit code and suggestions on how to improve the code along with the error statement from java.

I like the indentation and white space of the code, it makes it easier for me to read different blocks of the code.

I do not understand the purpose of the $() around some of the variables used in the code.
